# External APIs Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers the usage of external APIs, focusing on authentication, rate limits, and error handling. The primary example provided involves the integration with AWS S3 for file uploads.

## How it Works
External APIs allow applications to interact with services outside their own environment. In this case, the AWS S3 API is used to upload files. The process involves:

1. **Authentication**: Using environment variables to securely manage credentials.
2. **API Calls**: Making requests to the S3 service to perform operations like uploading files.
3. **Error Handling**: Implementing middleware to manage errors effectively.

## Key Components

### Authentication
- **Environment Variables**: The application retrieves AWS credentials and region settings from environment variables.
  - `AWS_REGION`: Specifies the AWS region.
  - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of the S3 bucket where files will be uploaded.

### API Interaction
- **S3 Client**: The `S3Client` from the AWS SDK is instantiated with the region and credentials.
- **PutObjectCommand**: This command is used to upload files to the specified S3 bucket.

### Error Handling
- **Middleware**: The application includes middleware functions for logging requests and handling errors.
  - **Logger**: Logs HTTP requests.
  - **Error Handler**: Catches errors and sends a 500 status response with an error message.

### Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the S3 upload process:

```javascript
const s3 = new S3Client({
  region: REGION,
  credentials: fromEnv(),
});

await s3.send(
  new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: BUCKET,
    Key: key,
    Body: body,
    ContentType: 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
  })
);
```

## Gotchas
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `S3_BUCKET_NAME` is set in your environment; otherwise, the application will throw an error during initialization [b583a3c6acf4-0000].
- **Rate Limits**: While not explicitly covered in the provided context, be aware that external APIs often have rate limits. Check the API documentation for specific limits and implement retry logic if necessary.
- **Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling to manage unexpected issues gracefully, as shown in the error handler middleware [dedaf00e393f-0000].

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a foundational understanding of integrating with external APIs, specifically AWS S3. For further details on specific APIs, consult their official documentation or explore additional examples within the repository.
