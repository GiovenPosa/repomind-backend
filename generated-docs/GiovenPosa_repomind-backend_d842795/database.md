# Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the database schema used by the application, focusing on the PostgreSQL setup, tables, indexes, and the implementation of vector search functionality.

## How it Works
The application connects to a PostgreSQL database using a connection pool. It utilizes the `pg` library to manage database connections and execute SQL queries. The schema is designed to support vector embeddings for AI functionalities, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data.

## Key Components

### Database Connection
- **Connection Pool**: Managed by the `Pool` class from the `pg` library.
- **Connection String**: Configured via the `SUPABASE_URL` environment variable.
- **SSL Configuration**: Controlled by the `DB_SSL` environment variable, allowing for secure connections when necessary.

### SQL Client
- **Type**: `SQLClient` interface defines a `query` method for executing SQL commands.
- **Client Management**: The `withClient` function ensures proper connection handling, releasing the client after use.

### Embedding and Generation Interfaces
- **Embedder Interface**: 
  - `name`: Identifier for the embedding source (e.g., "openai").
  - `dim`: Specifies the dimensionality of the embedding vectors.
  - `embed(texts: string[])`: Method to generate embeddings for an array of text inputs.
  
- **Generator Interface**:
  - `generate(prompt: string, opts?)`: Method to create text based on a prompt, with optional parameters for system instructions, maximum tokens, and temperature settings.

### Vector Search Implementation
- The schema supports vector search capabilities, which are essential for AI applications that require similarity searches among high-dimensional data.

## Gotchas
- **SSL Configuration**: Ensure that the `DB_SSL` environment variable is set correctly to avoid connection issues, especially in production environments.
- **Dimensionality**: The dimensionality of the embeddings must be consistent across different embedding sources to ensure compatibility during vector searches.

## Conclusion
This documentation provides a foundational understanding of the database schema and its components. For further details on specific tables and indexes, additional context from the database schema definition would be required.
