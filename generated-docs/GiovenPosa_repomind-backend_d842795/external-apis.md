# External APIs Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers the usage of external APIs, specifically focusing on OpenAI, GitHub, and AWS S3. It includes details on authentication, rate limits, and key components necessary for integration.

## How it Works
The integration with external APIs typically involves:

1. **Authentication**: Most APIs require an API key or other credentials for access.
2. **Making Requests**: Use SDKs or HTTP requests to interact with the API endpoints.
3. **Handling Responses**: Process the data returned by the API, which may include success messages, data payloads, or error messages.

### Example Workflows
- **AWS S3**: Uploading files to a specified bucket using the AWS SDK.
- **OpenAI**: Generating text or embeddings based on user prompts.

## Key Components

### AWS S3 Integration
- **SDK**: Uses `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for S3 operations.
- **Environment Variables**: Requires `AWS_REGION` and `S3_BUCKET_NAME` to be set in the environment.
- **Upload Example**:
  ```typescript
  const s3 = new S3Client({
    region: REGION,
    credentials: fromEnv(),
  });

  await s3.send(
    new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: BUCKET,
      Key: key,
      Body: body,
      ContentType: 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
    })
  );
  ```

### OpenAI Integration
- **SDK**: Utilizes the `openai` package for API interactions.
- **Authentication**: Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in the environment.
- **Embedding Example**:
  ```typescript
  const res = await this.client.embeddings.create({
    model: this.model,
    input: texts,
  });
  ```

- **Text Generation Example**:
  ```typescript
  const res = await this.client.chat.completions.create({
    model: this.model,
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: opts?.system ?? "You are a helpful codebase assistant." },
      { role: "user", content: prompt }
    ],
    max_tokens: opts?.maxTokens ?? 500,
    temperature: opts?.temperature ?? 0.2,
  });
  ```

## Gotchas
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set to avoid runtime errors, such as missing `S3_BUCKET_NAME` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` [b583a3c6acf4-0000].
- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of the rate limits imposed by the APIs. For OpenAI, check the documentation for specific limits on requests per minute or per day.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage API failures gracefully, as shown in the S3 upload example [b583a3c6acf4-0000].

## Conclusion
Integrating with external APIs like OpenAI and AWS S3 can enhance functionality but requires careful management of authentication, environment variables, and error handling. Always refer to the official API documentation for the most accurate and detailed information regarding usage limits and best practices.
