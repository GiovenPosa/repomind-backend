# Types & Interfaces Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the shared type definitions and interfaces used across various modules in the codebase. These types and interfaces facilitate consistent data structures and interactions within the application, enhancing maintainability and readability.

## How it Works
The types and interfaces are defined in TypeScript, providing strong typing for various components of the application. They are utilized across different modules, including document specifications, chunk records, request handling, S3 ingestion layouts, GitHub interactions, and AI functionalities.

### Key Types and Interfaces

| Type / Interface         | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DocSectionSpec`        | Defines the structure for documentation sections, including metadata like `id`, `title`, and `queries` [456ca691151e-0000]. |
| `DocCategory`           | Enumerates categories for documentation sections, such as "architecture" and "controllers" [456ca691151e-0000]. |
| `ChunkRecord`           | Represents a record of a code chunk, including metadata like `filePath`, `lang`, and `tokenCount` [3070df0354e3-0000]. |
| `ChunkIndex`            | Contains metadata about a collection of `ChunkRecord` entries, including the commit and generation timestamp [3070df0354e3-0000]. |
| `CustomRequest`         | Extends the Express `Request` object to include optional user information [cd7a0a5ed005-0000]. |
| `ErrorResponse`         | Defines the structure for error responses, including `status` and `message` [cd7a0a5ed005-0000]. |
| `S3IngestLayout`        | Specifies the layout for S3 ingestion, including `bucket`, `tenantId`, and `repo` [4efb545478a3-0000]. |
| `ManifestFileEntry`     | Represents an entry in a manifest file, detailing file metadata such as `path`, `sha`, and `size` [4efb545478a3-0000]. |
| `GithubRepositoryRef`   | Describes a GitHub repository reference, including details like `id`, `name`, and `owner` [f9f84e590ffc-0000]. |
| `Embedder`              | Interface for embedding functionalities, defining methods for generating embedding vectors [258eb093eb37-0000]. |
| `Generator`             | Interface for text generation, specifying methods for generating text based on prompts [258eb093eb37-0000]. |

## Gotchas
- Ensure that all modules importing these types and interfaces are aware of the expected structures to avoid runtime errors.
- When extending interfaces (e.g., `CustomRequest`), be cautious about the types being added to maintain type safety.
- The `DocSectionSpec` and its associated categories should be updated consistently to reflect any changes in documentation structure or requirements.

### Gaps
- This documentation does not cover the implementation details of how these types and interfaces are utilized in the application logic. For deeper insights, refer to the respective module implementations.
- Additional context on the specific use cases for each type/interface may be beneficial for new developers. Consider adding examples or references to relevant code sections.

For further exploration, please refer to the source files where these types and interfaces are defined:
- `src/types/docs.ts`
- `src/types/parser.ts`
- `src/types/index.ts`
- `src/types/s3.ts`
- `src/types/github.ts`
- `src/ai/interfaces.ts`
