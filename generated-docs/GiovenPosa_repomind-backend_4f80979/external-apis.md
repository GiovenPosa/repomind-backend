# External APIs Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of how to use external APIs within the application, focusing on authentication, rate limits, and error handling.

## How it Works
The application interacts with external APIs, such as AWS S3, to perform operations like uploading files. It utilizes middleware for logging requests and handling errors.

### Key Features
- **Logging**: Middleware logs incoming requests to the console.
- **Error Handling**: Middleware captures errors and sends a 500 status response.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Uses the AWS SDK to upload files to an S3 bucket.

## Key Components

### Middleware
- **Logger**: Logs the HTTP method and URL of incoming requests.
  ```typescript
  export const logger = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      next();
  };
  ```
- **Error Handler**: Captures errors and responds with a 500 status code.
  ```typescript
  export const errorHandler = (err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
  };
  ```

### AWS S3 Integration
- **Configuration**: The S3 client is configured using environment variables for region and bucket name.
- **Upload Process**:
  - Create an instance of `S3Client`.
  - Use `PutObjectCommand` to upload files.
  - Handle errors during the upload process.

```typescript
const s3 = new S3Client({
  region: REGION,
  credentials: fromEnv(),
});
```

### Example Upload Function
```typescript
async function main() {
  const key = 'test/hello.txt';
  const body = 'Hello S3 from RepoMind!';

  await s3.send(
    new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: BUCKET,
      Key: key,
      Body: body,
      ContentType: 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
    })
  );

  console.log(`âœ… Uploaded s3://${BUCKET}/${key}`);
}
```

## Gotchas
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that `AWS_REGION` and `S3_BUCKET_NAME` are set in the environment. Missing values will throw an error during initialization [b583a3c6acf4-0000].
- **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling in API calls to manage failures gracefully.

## Additional Considerations
- **Rate Limits**: The documentation does not specify rate limits for the external APIs used. Check the respective API documentation for details.
- **Authentication**: The current context does not detail the authentication mechanism for external APIs. Ensure to review the API's authentication requirements.

For further details, refer to the AWS SDK documentation and the API specifications of the services you are integrating with.
