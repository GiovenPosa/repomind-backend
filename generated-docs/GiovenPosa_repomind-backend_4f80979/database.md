# Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the database schema used in the application, focusing on the PostgreSQL schema, tables, indexes, and the usage of vector search capabilities.

## How it Works
The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval. It connects to the database using a connection pool, which allows for efficient management of database connections. The `withClient` function is used to execute SQL queries within a managed client context, ensuring that connections are properly released after use [e1016f650032-0000].

### Vector Search
The application employs vector search capabilities, which involve embedding text into high-dimensional vectors. This allows for efficient searching and retrieval of similar items based on their vector representations. The embedding process is handled by an `Embedder` interface, which defines methods for generating embeddings from text inputs [258eb093eb37-0000].

## Key Components

### Database Connection
- **Pool**: Manages connections to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Connection String**: Configured via the `SUPABASE_URL` environment variable.
- **SSL Configuration**: Controlled by the `DB_SSL` environment variable, allowing for secure connections.

### SQL Client
- **Type**: `SQLClient` interface defines a method for executing SQL queries.
- **Query Method**: Accepts SQL strings and optional parameters, returning a promise that resolves to an array of rows.

### Embedding and Generation Interfaces
- **Embedder**: 
  - `name`: Identifier for the embedding method (e.g., "openai").
  - `dim`: Dimensionality of the embedding vectors.
  - `embed(texts: string[])`: Method to generate embeddings for an array of texts.
  
- **Generator**: 
  - `generate(prompt: string, opts?)`: Method to generate text based on a prompt, with optional parameters for system instructions and token limits.

## Gotchas
- Ensure that the `DB_SSL` environment variable is set appropriately for your environment to avoid connection issues.
- The dimensionality of the embedding vectors must be consistent with the expectations of the downstream processing components.
- The application relies on proper management of database connections; failure to release clients can lead to connection leaks.

## Conclusion
This documentation outlines the essential components of the database schema and its interaction with vector search functionalities. For further details on specific tables and indexes, additional context may be required.
