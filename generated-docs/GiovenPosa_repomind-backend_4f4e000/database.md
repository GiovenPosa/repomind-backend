# Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the database schema used in the application, focusing on the PostgreSQL schema, tables, indexes, and the implementation of vector search functionality.

## How it Works
The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval. The connection to the database is managed through a connection pool, ensuring efficient handling of database connections. The schema supports vector search capabilities, which are essential for embedding and generating text.

### Connection Management
- The application uses the `pg` library to create a connection pool.
- The connection string is sourced from the environment variable `SUPABASE_URL`.
- SSL settings can be configured based on the environment, with an option to disable SSL for internal connections [e1016f650032-0000].

## Key Components

### Database Connection
- **Pool**: Manages multiple database connections.
- **SQLClient**: Interface for executing SQL queries.
- **withClient Function**: A utility function that handles the connection lifecycle, ensuring connections are released after use.

### Vector Search
- **Embedder Interface**: Defines methods for generating embedding vectors from text.
  - **name**: Identifier for the embedding method (e.g., "openai").
  - **dim**: Dimensionality of the embedding vectors.
  - **embed**: Method to generate embeddings for an array of texts [258eb093eb37-0000].

- **Generator Interface**: Provides functionality to generate text based on a prompt.
  - **generate**: Method that accepts a prompt and optional parameters to customize the generation process [258eb093eb37-0000].

### Tables and Indexes
- The specific tables and indexes used by the application are not detailed in the provided context. For a complete understanding, refer to the database migration files or schema definitions in the repository.

## Gotchas
- Ensure that the `DB_SSL` environment variable is set correctly based on the deployment environment to avoid connection issues.
- The dimensionality of the embedding vectors must be consistent across different embedding methods to ensure compatibility during vector searches.

## Conclusion
This documentation outlines the essential components of the database schema and its interaction with vector search functionalities. For further details on specific tables and indexes, please consult the database migration files or schema definitions in the repository.
